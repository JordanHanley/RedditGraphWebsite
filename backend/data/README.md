This is the directory where the Reddit Graph Data should be placed. The data is too large to be uploaded to Github.

Original data can be found here: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-RedditHyperlinks.html
The data must be parsed using RedditDataParser.cpp in the util folder and written again to the data folder.
