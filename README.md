R "Slash" Connect

Built with <3 by Jordan Hanley, Yair Temkin and Abishanka Saha
Developed for Final group project for COP3530, Fall 2021, University of Florida

Description: R "Slash" Connect is a website which helps visualize the path from 1 sub-reddit to another. We use 2 algorithms for that: Breadth for Search (BFS) 
and Dijkstra's Algorithm. This project is built on a C++ backend with a React Frontend.

Breadth for Search: Fast, but does not consider how connnected the two sub-reddits are; Naive approach
Dijkstra: Slow, but takes into account how connected 2 sub-reddits are to each other by taking into account the nummber of links between each other.
